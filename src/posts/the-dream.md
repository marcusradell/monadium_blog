# The Dream

*Programming is magic. It gives us the power to create things that can't exist, to compose innovations in new ways that only you can, to connect with the rest of the world.*

*If you'd like, I can show you some things I've learnt that might help you on your journey. But first, let me ask you a few questions about yourself...* 

*Actually, just fill out this form, it's just more time-efficient!*

## **Please fill out the form**

**Email: marcus+monadium@radell.net**
