## Monadium Begins - Foreword

My name is Marcus RÃ¥dell and I want to build a portal for people that want to reach the promised land of programming. Some come here for the money, others for the power to create. I came searching for truth. I want to understand the world and how it works. I want to experiment and learn. As a part of learning, one helps and teaches. This will be my portal to help bring more developers to through to the other side where they want to go. I will call this place Monadium.

The first phase of Monadium will focus on recruiting candidates for their dream jobs. I don't mean to match you up with any company out there and then call you a year later "just to catch up on things" (try to earn more money by getting you to leave). I want to focus on your dreams, to tap into your intrinsic motivation, and then find a company where you can be the best you possible.

This means that we need to disrupt the economical engine and fine-tune it. We need to find a way to earn our pay based on the value we bring. Each month you want to stay at your current company, we ask *(you to sign the dotted line)* that you throw us a coin. If you want to quit, we need to help you find a new dream job, or the coins stop flowing. This means that you will have your own agent taking care of your career and giving advice with your best in mind.

Monadiums vision is to create a union of programmers that help each other to fullfil their dreams.

Monadiums mission is to create a high-accuracy job-matching service where devs can get their dream job.

 I will use a language that is based on a fantasy setting. I will try to tell a story that makes you feel like you are part of something fictional. I want to erase your preconceptions of what is possible in the real world you live in and start thinking about what is possible on the other side of this portal. You will meet "The Dream", a narrating voice that will ask about your dreams, try to motivate and inspire. You will also meet "The Form", which is more like a grumpy golem who represents the parts of programming that you want to punch in the face.

The design esthetics will be based on cyberpunk with orange, blue, and pink. The site should feel a bit like an arcade game, and the UX should be fast-loading and effective to not break the illusion of the storytelling.

My hope is that I can create such a strong pull into this world that it feels safer to create content in a more personal way. That you, the user, dare to engage in a way that you wouldn't on some generic career platform. I dare to dream that I can get you to upload a personal presentation video, spell out exactly what you want, and search for those jobs you wish you were good enough to apply for.

OK, now, let's see if we can give the storytelling part a go, shall we?



## Dream

*Programming is magic. It gives us the power to create things that can't exist, to compose innovations in new ways that only you can, to connect with the rest of the world.*

*If you'd like, I can show you some things I've learnt that might help you on your journey. But first, let me ask you a few questions about yourself...* 

*This form will help you fill out the details, and then we can meet up inside. I have a surprise for you once you get there!*
